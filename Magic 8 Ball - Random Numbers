#Background - In this project, I use CONTROL FLOW and IF/ELIF/ELSE statements to evaluate a user's question to a Magic 8-Ball using a pre-populated random import in Python. The program 
assigns a random number (randint) to answer the user's question, then populates the output (answer) based on the random number assigned:

#Random file is imported.

import random


#Variables are assigned, with answer remaining blank (based on random number assignment).

name = "Winnie"
question = "Will I achieve my career goals?"
answer = ""


#Program selects a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

random_number = random.randint(1, 9)

#print(random_number)


#Program evaluates Magic 8-Ball's answer based on random number assigned.

if random_number == 1:
  answer = "Yes - definitely"
elif random_number == 2:
  answer = "It is decidedly so"
elif random_number == 3:
  answer = "Without a doubt"
elif random_number == 4:
  answer = "Reply hazy, try again"
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = "Ask again later"
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = "Better not tell you now"
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = "My sources say no"
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = "Outlook not so good"
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = "Very doubtful"
else:
  answer = "Error"


#Program prints the name of the person, the question they asked the Magic 8-Ball and the answer generated by random number selection. 
  
print(name, "asks:", question)
print()
print("Magic 8-Ball's answer:", answer)


#Final outcome could also be printed using concatenation method (based on programmer's preference).

print(name + " asks: " + question)
print()
print("Magic 8-Ball's answer: " + answer)


###The following code gives additional options for altering the conditions within the user input:


#Extend the range of random numbers that can be assigned within the Magic-8 Ball to 11 total numbers and add additional conditional statements for #10-#11. 

random_number = random.randint(1, 11)
#print(random_number)

if random_number == 1:
  answer = ("Yes - definately")
elif random_number == 2:
  answer = ("It is decidedly so")
elif random_number == 3:
  answer = ("Without a doubt")
elif random_number == 4:
  answer = ("Reply hazy, try again")
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = ("Ask again later")
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = ("Better not tell you now")
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = ("My sources say no")
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = ("Outlook not so good")
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = ("Very doubtful")
elif random_number == 10:
    answer = ("Not a chance")
elif random_number == 11:
    answer = ("It is written in the stars!")
else:
  answer = ("Error")

#On the occurence of the user not inputting their name or a question, write conditional statements for output.

if name == "":
  print ("Question: " + question)
if question == "":
  print("The Magic 8-Ball cannot provide a fortune unless you ask it something.")
else:
  print(name + " asks: " + question)    
  print("Magic 8-Ball's answer: " + answer)
