#Background - In this project, I used IF/ELIF statements to evaluate a user's question to a Magic 8-Ball using a pre-populated random import in Python. The program 
assigns a random number (randint) to answer the user's question, then populates the output (answer) based on the random number assigned:

#Random file is imported:

import random


#Variables are assigned, with answer remaining blank (based on random number assignment)

name = "Winnie"
question = "Will I achieve my career goals?"
answer = ""


#Program selects a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive)

random_number = random.randint(1, 9)

#print(random_number)


#Program evaluates Magic 8-Ball's answer based on random number assigned

if random_number == 1:
  answer = "Yes - definitely"
elif random_number == 2:
  answer = "It is decidedly so"
elif random_number == 3:
  answer = "Without a doubt"
elif random_number == 4:
  answer = "Reply hazy, try again"
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = "Ask again later"
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = "Better not tell you now"
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = "My sources say no"
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = "Outlook not so good"
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = "Very doubtful"
else:
  answer = "Error"


#Program prints the name of the person, the question they asked the Magic 8-Ball and the answer generated by random number selection
  
print(name, "asks:", question)
print()
print("Magic 8-Ball's answer:", answer)


#Final outcome could also be printed using concatenation method (based on programmer's preference)

print(name + " asks: " + question)
print()
print("Magic 8-Ball's answer: " + answer)
