#Background - In this code, I use CONTROL FLOW and IF/ELIF/ELSE statements to determine whether a given (input) highway number
is a primary or auxiliary highway and whether it runs north/south or east/west. 

#Primary U.S. Interstate Highways are numbered 1-99.
#Odd numbers go north/south.
#Even numbers go east/west.
#Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999 and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits.
  *200 is NOT a valid auxiliary highway because 00 is not a valid primary highway number. This is represented in the code below*


#Get interstate highway number from user input:

highway_number = int(input())

if 1 <= highway_number <= 99:  # Primary U.S. interstate highways
    if highway_number % 2 == 0:
            direction = "east/west"
    else:
        direction = "north/south"
    print(f"I-{highway_number} is primary, going {direction}.")
elif 100 <= highway_number <= 199 or 201 <= highway_number <= 999:  # Auxiliary highways
        primary_highway = highway_number % 100
        if primary_highway % 2 == 0:
            direction = "east/west"
        else:
            direction = "north/south"
        print(f"I-{highway_number} is auxiliary, serving I-{primary_highway}, going {direction}.")
else:
    print(f"{highway_number} is not a valid interstate highway number.")
