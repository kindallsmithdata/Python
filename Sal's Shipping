#Background - In this project, I use CONTROL FLOW and IF/ELIF/ELSE statements to evaluate the shipping costs for various sized packages. Ground, 
Premium and Drone shipping costs are all calculated. This is code is useful for the consumer to compare shipping costs for packages and easily 
determine the least expensive option. 



#User inputs weight of package (manual)

weight = ()


# Hardcoded values for this tool. Could be input()...

weight = int(input("Enter package weight: "))

Enter package weight:




#Calculate Ground Shipping

if weight <= 2:
  cost_ground = (weight * 1.50 + 20.00)
  print(f'${cost_ground:.2f}')
elif 2 < weight <= 6:
  cost_ground = (weight * 3.00 + 20.00)
  print(f'${cost_ground:.2f}')
elif 6 < weight <= 10:
  cost_ground = (weight * 4.00 + 20.00)
  print(f'${cost_ground:.2f}')
else:
  cost_ground = (weight * 14.25 + 20.00)
  print(f'${cost_ground:.2f}')



#Calculate Ground Premium Shipping

cost_ground_premium = 125.00
print(f'Ground Shipping Premium ${cost_ground_premium:.2f}')



#Calculate Drone Shipping

if weight <= 2:
  cost_drone = (weight * 4.50 + 0.00)
  print(f'${cost_drone:.2f}')
elif 2 < weight <= 6:
  cost_drone = (weight * 9.00 + 0.00)
  print(f'${cost_drone:.2f}')
elif 6 < weight <= 10:
  cost_drone = (weight * 12.00 + 0.00)
  print(f'${cost_drone:.2f}')
else:
  cost_drone = (weight * 14.25 + 0.00)
  print(f'${cost_drone:.2f}')
  



#Calculate the cost of a package that weighs 8.4 pounds to ship with normal GROUND SHIPPING:

$53.60



#Calculate the cost of GROUND SHIPPING PREMIUM:

$125.00



#Calculate the cost of a package that weighs 1.5 pounds with DRONE SHIPPING: 

$6.75



#What is the cheapest method of shipping a 4.8 pound package and how much would it cost?

Result (Output) = 

$34.40 
Ground Shipping Premium $125.00
$43.20

***For 4.8 pounds, GROUND SHIPPING is the cheapest option.




#What is the cheapest method of shipping a 41.5 pound package and how much would it cost?

Result (Output) =

$217.12
Ground Shipping Premium $125.00
$591.38

***For 41.5 pounds, GROUND PREMIUM SHIPPING is the cheapest option.
